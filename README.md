        About me
    </h2>
    <p>I am curious in the field of renewable energy and sustainability. I have always wanted to create a positive impact and with the growing issue of climate change, sustainability stood out to me. I also have some interests in AI and machine-learning. On my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and sports, specifically ultimate frisbee. I also like photography and videography.</p>
